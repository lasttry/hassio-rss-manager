This add-on allows you to:

- Periodically fetch and parse multiple RSS feeds (e.g., ShowRSS, Jackett).
- Store items locally with persistent status (`new`, `sent`, etc.).
- Expose a local API endpoint (e.g., `/rss`) for frontend consumption.
- Integrate with Lovelace UI using custom cards.

> Fully self-contained. Does not require external databases.
